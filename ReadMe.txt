Deployment of AI model directly from GITHUB using Streamlit webapp:


The following files are present in GitHub (https://github.com/jobinvargheset/GITHUB_TO_STREAMLIT_DEPLOYMENT-POST-COVID-19-PSYCHOLOGICAL-ISSUES-.git)
 

        1.Covid_19_effects.ipynb - interactive python note book
        2.Covid_effect.csv  - Dataset
        3.Streamlit_app.py  - Steamlit code written file
        4.Covid_preprocessed_data.csv - independent data used for uploading into streamlit graphical user interface (GUI) after deployment 
        5.Decision_tree_model_covid.pkl  - Pickle model of machine learning model
        6.requirements.txt  - Required libraries to be installed


               
Procedure to upload to streamlit directly from GITHUB:


Step 1: Open the Streamlit webpage : https://streamlit.io/


Step 2: Sign up in to Streamlit web application either using your google account or GitHub account or using your email address.


Step 3. If already signed up in streamlit web app, then avoid step 2. Sign in into Streamlit app using your google account or GitHub account or using your email address.


Step 4: Click on "Create app" button. 

Step 5: Select "Deploy a public app from GitHub". Then 4 blank rectangular box spaces (Repository, Branch, Main file path, App URL(optional)) will appear to fill the data.  The columns are filled with the following data : 

1. Repository  : https://github.com/NimishaKR887/streamlit.git
2. Branch  : Main (Usually this is defined in GitHub)
3. Main file path : Streamlit_app.py


Step 6: When you enter the data in above three 3 blank rectangular box spaces, the fourth column (App URL(optional)) will be automatically filled with a url generated by streamlit. 


 Step 7: Click on the deploy button. Then the app starts initiating (showing a message that "your app is in the oven")


Step 8: When step 7 is executed, a web application is displayed, where we can upload a a portion of training data set (independent) with same number of features as in the training data set, the web app will classify whether the person affected by the covid has affected by post covid psychological effect or not?
